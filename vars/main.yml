# Enable SSH pipelining
# The normal transfer methods (scp/sftp) do not work with the chroot wrapper
# hack, so we need to make sure that they are not needed for running modules
# inside the chroot by enabling pipelining.

# Use 'piped' SSH transfer method
# For the reason noted above, file transfers using scp/sftp do not work, so
# we force the use of the new 'piped' transfer method. This feature is not
# available until Ansible 2.3, but neither is the following config option, so
# this will be a no-op on older versions.
# This role does not actually require this (yet), but it would be nice to use
# the 'copy' module in the future.
